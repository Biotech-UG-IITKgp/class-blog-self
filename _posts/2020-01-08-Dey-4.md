## Protein Engineering

Solid state chemistry. What is a crystal? Crystal lattice and structure. Growth of crystals.

Symmetry elements.

7 Lattice systems:

| **Name**     | **Sides**  | **Angles**                      |
| ------------ | ---------- | ------------------------------- |
| Triclinic    | None equal | None equal to 90                |
| Monoclinic   | None equal | alpha = Gamma = 90; beta not 90 |
| Orthorhombic | None equal | all equal to 90                 |
| Tetragonal   |            |                                 |
| Trigonal     |            | gamma = 120                     |
| Cubic        | All equal  | All equal to 90                 |
| Hexagonal    |            |                                 |

## Immunology

[Will have to read notes]

Topics:

1. What is Immunology?
2. Big challenge.
3. History
4. Books
5. Types of blood cells
6. Two types of immune systems - Innate and adaptive.
7. Brief functions of different blood cells.

## Bioinfo

[RPB]

Reading a PDB (protein database) file. Inferring the structure of the protein from the pdb file.

What is ENEMA?

Different keywords in the PDB file. (TER, HETATM)

Different levels of protein folding. (2 degree - protein folding)

3 types of alpha-helix

## PCTC

Nothing interesting. Introduction of what goes on in the STEP Labs.
